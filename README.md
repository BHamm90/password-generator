<h1>Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this activity was to use javascript to create a functional password generator. The user should have multiple options to choose from such as the length of the password, whether they would like upper or lower case letter, number and/or symbols in their password. Then by the functions we created in the background the password should appear in the textarea with all the correct criteria.</p> 

<h2>Task List:</h2>
<p>Deploy a Functional Password Generator to a Webpage
Provide a prompt that finds out the length the user would like.
Provide multiple confirms to find out what options the user would like.
Every prompt needs to have an answer, even invaild options.
Password should auto generate and display in textarea.</p>

<h3>Looking Forward:</h3>

<p>Looking forward I would like to continue updating this password generator with bug fixes and suggestions given to me by other users. I would as like to see if I can go back and do anything to shorten and clean up the code. Finally I would like to see what other functions are available for use to make this generator more interactive.</p>
